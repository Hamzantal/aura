#  Aura - Discord

Aura is a discord bot focused on rewarding user contributions through
a point system called karma. It has the following features:

* Give out karma on messages containing thanks, ty, thank you case-insensitive
with a single non bot user mention.
* Blacklist and Whitelist Members from giving out karma.
    * Blacklisted Members will get a DM specifying who to contact to dispute it
* Karma Profile with the Profile Picture, full name (name + discriminator) or nick,
total karma and karma breakdown by top x channels configured.
* Cooldown Members from giving out karma after giving it out or set the timer to 0.
* Reset all Karma of a Member in a guild
* Delete karma on message delete of the triggering message.
* Change most configuration on the fly by providing keys from the config.yaml
